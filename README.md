## 🕸🌆 High-Level System Design (HLD) 🏗🚧
### 1️⃣ Fundamentals of System Design

#### Key Concepts

- 🌟 **Scalability (Vertical vs. Horizontal):** Understanding how to grow your system to handle increased load.
- 🌟 **High Availability & Fault Tolerance:** Ensuring your system remains operational even when components fail.
- 🌟 **Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance (CAP Theorem):** Navigating the trade-offs in distributed systems.
- 🌟 **Latency vs. Throughput:** Distinguishing between response time and processing capacity.
- 🌟 **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic efficiently across multiple servers.

#### Important Metrics

- 🔹 **Response Time (P50, P95, P99 latency):** Measuring the time it takes for requests to be processed.
- 🔹 **Requests per second (RPS/QPS):** Tracking the number of requests your system can handle.
- 🔹 **System Uptime (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.):** Evaluating the reliability of your system.

###  2️⃣ Load Balancing 🖧 🏋

📌 **Why?** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.

####  Types of Load Balancers

- **DNS Load Balancing (e.g., Route 53):** Distributes traffic at the DNS level.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB) (Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS-based):** Routes traffic based on application-level
  information.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB) (Layer 4, TCP-based):** Routes traffic based on network-level information.
- **Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy):** Acts as an intermediary between clients and servers.

####  Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Round Robin:** Distributes requests sequentially.
- **Least Connections:** Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hashing:** Routes requests based on the client's IP address.

###  3️⃣ Caching

📌 **Why?** Improves performance by reducing database calls.

####  Types of Caching

- **Client-Side Cache (Browser cache, CDN):** Stores data on the client side.
- **Server-Side Cache (In-memory like Redis, Memcached):** Stores frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Database Caching (Read Replicas, Query Optimization):** Optimizes database performance.

####  Cache Invalidation Strategies

- **Write-through:** Updates the cache and database simultaneously.
- **Write-back:** Updates the cache and writes to the database later.
- **Least Recently Used (LRU):** Evicts the least recently used items from the cache.

####  CDN (Content Delivery Network) 🌐

- Distributes static content globally.
- Examples: Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront.

###  4️⃣ Database Design ⛃

📌 **Choosing the right database:**

####  Relational (SQL) – MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS

- Strong consistency, ACID properties.
- Used for transactions, banking systems.

####  NoSQL – MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB

- Schema-less, scalable.
- Used for high-volume, unstructured data (social media, logs).

####  Sharding vs. Replication 👥

- **Sharding:** Partitioning data across multiple servers.
- **Replication:** Copying data across multiple servers.

###  5️⃣ Microservices🧩 & API Design

📌 **Microservices vs. Monoliths**

- **Microservices:** Scalable, modular, independent.
- **Monolith:** Easier development but less scalable.

####  Inter-service Communication

- **REST API:** Standard web-based communication.
- **gRPC:** High-performance RPC framework.
- **Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ):** Asynchronous communication.

####  API Gateway (Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway)

- Manages authentication, throttling, logging.

####  Rate Limiting & Security

- OAuth, JWT for authentication.
- API Key-based access.
- Rate Limiting using Redis.

###  6️⃣ Message Queues» & Event-Driven Architecture 

📌 **Why?** Decouples services, increases reliability.

####  Message Brokers

- **Kafka (Distributed, durable):** High-throughput, fault-tolerant.
- **RabbitMQ (Lightweight, real-time messaging):** Flexible routing, reliable delivery.

####  Event-Driven System

- Producers send events.
- Consumers process asynchronously.

####  Use Cases

- Order processing in e-commerce.
- Logging & monitoring systems.

###  7️⃣ Distributed Storage & File Systems

📌 **Why?** Handle petabytes of data efficiently.

####  Distributed File Systems

- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
- Google File System (GFS).

####  Object Storage

- AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.

####  SQL vs. NoSQL for Storage

- SQL for transactions.
- NoSQL for high-volume, unstructured data.

###  8️⃣ Scaling Strategies

📌 **How to scale a system?**

####  Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)

- Adding more CPU/RAM to a single server.
- Limited by hardware capacity.

####  Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)

- Adding more machines.
- Used in distributed systems.

####  Database Scaling

- Read Replicas (for read-heavy systems).
- Partitioning (Sharding).

###  9️⃣ Observability & Monitoring

📌 **Why?** Debugging and performance tuning.

####  Logging Tools

- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Splunk.

####  Metrics & Monitoring

- Prometheus + Grafana (Real-time monitoring).
- AWS CloudWatch.

####  Alerting Systems

- PagerDuty.
- OpsGenie.

###  🔟 System Design Case Studies

📌 **Common interview problems:**

- Design YouTube (Video storage, CDN, streaming).
- Design Uber (Real-time tracking, matching algorithms).
- Design Twitter (Timelines, caching, rate limiting).
- Design WhatsApp (Messaging queues, real-time sync).

📌 **How to Approach a System Design Interview?**

1. **Clarify Requirements:** Functional (What features are needed?), Non-functional (Latency, availability,
   scalability).
2. **Define High-Level Design:** Identify core components (API Gateway, Load Balancers, Databases, etc.).
3. **Break Down Components:** Database choice, caching strategy, API design.
4. **Address Scalability & Bottlenecks:** Vertical vs. Horizontal scaling, Optimize database queries.
5. **Discuss Trade-offs:** CAP theorem: Consistency vs. Availability.
